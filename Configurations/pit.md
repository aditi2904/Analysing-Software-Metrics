We have used Pit-Test tool to calculate the mutation testing metrics.

We used the Pit-test with the following steps:

1. Install pitest plugin by adding the plugin 'Pitclipse' from Eclipse marketplace.
2. Build the projects and remove error if any.
3. Open Run configurations and select Pitclipse.
4. Pit-reports are generated in `.meta-data` directory of the eclipse workspace.
