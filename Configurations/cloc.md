
We have used cloc tool to calculate the lines of code for post release defect density metrics.

We used the Cloc with the following steps:
Downloaded cloc.exe from SourceForgeNet.
To run cloc on Windows computers, we have to open up a command (aka DOS) window and invoke cloc.exe from the command line there for the desired Project.
Number of Blank lines , Comment lines , Lones of code gets displayed on Command Prompt.
We have copied the results of cloc tool in excel files for their corresponding version under PostReleaseDefectDensity Folder in DefectDensity File.
