Either

(a) The id for PrivateStorage items needs to be more unique (e.g. the serviceID) (i.e. this only affects PrivateStorage items), or

(b) The itemKey should be made up of a concatenation of serviceID + nodeID + id (which matches the PK on the table) (i.e. this affects all PublishedItems).

I'm out of my depth, now. Perhaps someone else can chime in.","11/19/18 09:57 AM;gdt;After some reflection, I think the correct answer is option b) above.

One of the most common issues seems to be related to permissions, as Openfire for some reason is not able to update config files although users report permissions are correct and hasn't changed.

Another often mentioned issue is with timezone ID in the database connection string. This can be related to Java update, though Debian version doesn't have Java bundled. Users have to update timezone ID to something else.

Some users also report logs being completely empty.",Debian,,,,,,,,,No,,,,https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-4-2-3-to-4-3-2-upgrade-issues/84121,0|i019y7:,No,02/08/19 08:09 AM;wroot;Another report with Debian Jessy https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/debian-jessie-openfire-4-2-3-to-4-3-2-upgrade/84163,"02/13/19 05:08 PM;gdt;The thread at [https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/can-not-update-from-4-2-3-to-4-3-2-on-debian/84196/3] suggests that the install process prompts about over-writing a changed openfire.xml

I know next-to-nothing about .deb files but given openfire.xml will have always changed from the previous install, I wonder if that prompt can somehow be suppressed and the ""use existing file"" option always taken. I can't see a circumstance when an upgrade should use the ""new"" openfire.xml in preference to the existing one.",02/14/19 09:34 AM;wroot;I wonder if timezone issue is related to mysql connector update.,"02/14/19 03:05 PM;wroot;Also, not just upgrade, but fresh installs are problematic for people on Debian. I have just tried to do this in my Ubuntu VM and i run into same permissions issue like with Windows, when launcher is running without Run as admin option. I can only run Openfire via sudo without issues. If i run with regular user, it shows Current password prompt during fresh setup similar as in https://issues.igniterealtime.org/browse/OF-1298

After reading through that post i can't figure out the right approach. To many different suggestions. Certainly wouldn't be ok if you have to change that string twice per year (another vote for stopping clock moving madness..:))",,,,,
