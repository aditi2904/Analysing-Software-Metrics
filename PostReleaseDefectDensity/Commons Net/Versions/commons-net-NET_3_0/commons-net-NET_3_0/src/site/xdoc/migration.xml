<section name="Migration How-To">
<p>
This how-to lists the migration steps for moving between versions of Commons Net.
</p>
</section>

<section name="Commons Net 2.x to Commons Net 3.0">
    <p>
        Version 3.0 is binary compatible with version 2.0. There should be no changes required to existing binary code.
    </p>
    <p>        
        However, version 3.0 is <b>not source compatible</b> with 2.0.
    </p>
    <p>        
        Several obsolete/unused constants have been removed.<br/>
        (Such changes do not affect binary code, because compilers are required to localise constants).<br/>
        The <a href="clirr-report.html">clirr report</a> shows which constants have been removed.
        If any source code happens to be using one of these constants, then the source will have to be updated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, some throws clauses have been removed from methods which did not actually throw them.<br/>
        Throws clauses are not part of method signatures, so do not affect binary compatibility.<br/>
        The following public methods no longer throw IOException:
        <ul>
        <li>TelnetClient#addOptionHandler(TelnetOptionHandler)</li>
        <li>TelnetClient#deleteOptionHandler(int)</li>
        </ul>
        Source code using these methods will need to be updated.
    </p>
</section>

<section name="Commons Net 1.4.x to Commons Net 2.0">
    <p>
        Version 2.0 requires a JDK 5.0+ runtime. It has also been tested on JDK 6.0. There should
        be no changes required to existing client code.
    </p>
</section>

<section name="NetComponents 1.3.8  to  Commons Net 1.x">
<p>
This version is a drop in replacement for NetComponents.  Only package names have changed.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Change all occurances of <tt>com.oroinc.net.*</tt> to <tt>org.apache.commons.net.*</tt></li>
  <li>Change all occurances of <tt>com.oroinc.io.*</tt> to <tt>org.apache.commons.net.io.*</tt></li>
  <li>Change all occurances of <tt>com.oroinc.util.*</tt> to <tt>org.apache.commons.net.util.*</tt></li>
</ol>
